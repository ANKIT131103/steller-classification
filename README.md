# 🌌 Celestial Object Classification 🚀

This project aims to develop a **classification model** that accurately identifies celestial objects—specifically **stars, galaxies, and quasars**—based on their **spectral characteristics**. Using a dataset of **100,000 observations** from the **Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)**, the model is trained to differentiate between these celestial objects, ensuring **high accuracy and generalization** for new, unseen data.

## 🔭 Data Source
**Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)** – A comprehensive survey of space, providing detailed **imaging and spectroscopic data** of celestial objects.

## 📊 Dataset Description
- **Total Observations:** 100,000
- **Features:** Spectral characteristics of celestial objects
- **Classes:**
  - ⭐ **Stars**
  - 🌌 **Galaxies**
  - 💫 **Quasars**


## 🏆 Classification Models Used
This project explores multiple classifiers to achieve the best results:
- **Random Forest Classifier** 🌲
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** 📈
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** 📍
- **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)** ⚡
- **Neural Networks (MLP)** 🧠
